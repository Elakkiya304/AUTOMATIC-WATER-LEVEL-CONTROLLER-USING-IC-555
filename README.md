# ⚡ AUTOMATIC WATER LEVEL CONTROLLER

A smart and automatic system to monitor and control the water level in a tank using a **555 Timer IC**. The pump turns **ON** when water is low and **OFF** when the tank is full — saving water, energy, and time. 💧⚙️

## 📘 **Abstract**

This project presents an **automatic water level controller** that uses the **555 timer IC in bistable mode** to detect tank water levels.
When the water level is low, the pump turns **ON**.
When the tank is full, the pump turns **OFF** automatically.
This prevents overflow, conserves water, and protects the pump from dry running.

## 🏁 **Introduction**

An automatic water level controller monitors and maintains water levels without human involvement.
Using level probes and a 555 timer IC, the system activates the pump when water falls to the lower threshold and deactivates it when the upper threshold is reached.
Ideal for **homes, agriculture, industries, and buildings**.
